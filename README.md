# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to use different machine learning techniques to evaluate credit risk.
Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.

## Results :

### Precision, Recall and F1 score:

![]()

#### True Positive (TP) 
When a transaction is predicted to be fraudulent and is really a fraudulent transaction.

#### False Positive (FP) 
When a transaction is predicted to be fraudulent and is not a fraudulent transaction.

#### False Negative (FN) 
When a transaction is predicted to be non-fraudulent and is really a fraudulent transaction.

#### True Negative (TN) 
When a transaction is predicted to be non-fraudulent and is reality is a non-fraudulent transaction.

#### Precision

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

*Precision* is the ration of correctly predicted *positve* observations to the total predicted positive observations.
Precision attempts to answer, what portion of postive identifications were actually correct.

#### Recall (Sensitivity)

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

*Recall* is the ratio of correctly predicted *postive* observations to the total positive observations.
Recall attempts to answer, what portion of actual positives were identified correctly.

#### F1 Score 

F1 score = 2 * ( Precision * Sensitivity) / (Precision + Sensitivity)

### Machine Learning Models :


#### 1. Random Oversampling 


#### 2. SMOTE Oversampling


#### 3. Cluster Centroids (Undersampling)


#### 4. SMOTEENN


#### 5. Balaned Random Forest Classifier


#### 6. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
